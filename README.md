# prom-utils

Promise utilities designed for looping.

## rateLimit

Limit the concurrency of promises. This can be used to control
how many requests are made to a server, for example.

```typescript
// Limit concurrency to at most 3
const limiter = rateLimit(3)

for (const url of urls) {
    await limiter.add(fetch(url))
}
// Wait for unresolved promises to resolve
await limiter.finish()
```

## batchQueue

Batch calls via a local queue. This can be used to batch values before
writing to a database, for example.

Automatically executes `fn` when `batchSize` is reached or `timeout` is
reached, if set. The timer will be started when the first item is
enqueued and reset when flush is called explicitly or implicitly.

Call `queue.flush()` to flush explicitly.

Batch size defaults to 500. The last result of calling `fn` can be
obtained by referencing `lastResult` on the returned object.

**Types**

```typescript
export type QueueResult = {
    flush(): Promise<void>
    enqueue(item: any): Promise<void>
    lastResult?: any
}

export interface QueueOptions {
    batchSize?: number
    batchBytes?: number
    timeout?: number
}

export type Queue = (
    fn: (arr: any[]) => any,
    options?: QueueOptions
) => QueueResult
```

**Example**

```typescript
const writeToDatabase = async (records) => {...}
const batchSize = 250

const queue = batchQueue(writeToDatabase, {batchSize})
for (const record of records) {
  await queue.enqueue(record)
}
await queue.flush()
```

## pausable

Pause a loop by awaiting `proceed`. When `pause` is called `proceed` will
return a promise that is resolved when `resume` is called. Otherwise,
`proceed` will return immediately. If `timeout` is passed, `resume` will
be called after `timeout` if it is not manually called first.

```typescript
const shouldProcess = pausable()

onSomeCondition(shouldProcess.pause)
onSomeOtherCondition(shouldProcess.resume)

for (const record of records) {
    await shouldProcess.proceed()
    await processRecord(record)
}
```

## defer

Defer resolving a promise until `done` is called.

```typescript
const delay = (milliseconds: number) => {
    const deferred = defer()
    setTimeout(deferred.done, milliseconds, 'ðŸ¦„')
    return deferred.promise
}
```

## pacemaker

Call heartbeatFn every interval until promise resolves or rejects.
Returns the value of the resolved promise.

```typescript
const heartbeatFn = () => {
    // Emit heartbeat
}

const result = await pacemaker(heartbeatFn, someProm)
```

## waitUntil

Wait until the predicate returns truthy or the timeout expires.
Returns a promise.

```typescript
let isTruthy = false
global.setTimeout(() => {
    isTruthy = true
}, 250)
await waitUntil(() => isTruthy)
```
